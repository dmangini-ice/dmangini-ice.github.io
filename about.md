Danielle is currently a graduate student at the Univeristy of Massachusetts, Amherst working under the supervision of Dr. Rob DeConto. Presently, she is researching the Greenland Ice Sheet's stability during the Holocene (12,000 years ago to present).

During 2023-2024, Danielle worked with Dr. Mathieu Morlighem at Dartmouth College where she investigated topographic uncertainty beneath the Antarctic Ice Sheet and how that uncertainty relates towards future sea level projections.

Before Darmouth College, Danielle graduated Cum Laude from Cornell University in Earth and Atmospheric Sciences and a minor in Environment and Sustainability.

At UMass, she is the social media "guy" for the Geoscience Graduate Student Organization and also plays volleyball with others in her department. Outside of science, Danielle loves to knit, crochet, hike, ski, and swim all while traveling.

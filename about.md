Danielle is currently a graduate student at the Univeristy of Massachusetts, Amherst working under the supervision of Dr. Rob DeConto. Presently, she is researching the Greenland Ice Sheet's stability during the Holocene (12,000 years ago to present).

During 2023-2024, Danielle worked with Dr. Mathieu Morlighem at Dartmouth College where she investigated topographic uncertainty beneath the Antarctic Ice Sheet and how that uncertainty relates towards future sea level projections.

Before Darmouth College, Danielle graduated Cum Laude from Cornell University in Earth and Atmospheric Sciences and a minor in Environment and Sustainability.

Centrarium is a custom theme for Jekyll, made by [Ben Centra][bencentra] for his own blog. He'd be humbled if you liked it enough to use it as well! Installation and configuration instructions can be found in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/bencentra/centrarium).

This page is a good place to write about yourself, your project, your product, or whatever it is your site is for. You can replace the image above, or you can get rid of it entirely.

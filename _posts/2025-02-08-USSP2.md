I started my journey to Urbino, Italy on Monday July 21st from Boston Logan Airport. It was a long travel day where I had a layover in ZÃ¼rich, Switzerland. Once I arrived in Bologna, Italy I had to take a train to Pessaro and then a bus to Urbino. Lets just say that I was exhausted after my 18 hour travel day.

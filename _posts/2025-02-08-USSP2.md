Starting on July 23rd until August 8th, I will be venturing to Urbino, Italy where I will be taking a class on Paleoclimatology! There I will be learning more about past climates and how to look at different prroxys as clues for past temperatures, precipitation, and other climatic variables. I will be sharing some adventures and what I have been learning. Stay tuned!
